Thanks to Matt Ashenfarb for providing helpful code on the suites index.

# Set Up and Definitions 

The **outcomes of interest** is how the amount of LWCF funds and quantity of grants are distributed across demographic characteristics of interest. 

Originally I used two different per capita measurements for the amount of LWCF funds and quantity of grants.

1. Funds (or quantity of grants) given to a county  divided by the population of the county at the time of LWCF distribution. This captures how the program was administered through time.
2. The cumulative amount of funds (or quantity of grants) given to a county from 1965-2018 divided by the population of the county in 2020 (estimates for population of each county is not available for each county in 2018 in the American Community Survey). This captures how individuals today are effected by the LWCF program.

After both per capita metrics returned similar results (stored in commit from Sept 20th, 2022), I used the first definition which can be interpreted as how the program has been administered historically. 

I use per capita metrics for amount of funding and quantity of grants to control for a county's population. 

## Demographics of Interest (x axis)
We are interested in the distribution of funds across three county-level demographic characteristics: median income, % POC, % rural. 

**Average median household income**: the median household income (averaged from 1965-2018 for each county). 

**Average percent people of color**: the percent of people in a color who are not non-Hispanic white (averaged from 1965-2018 for each county). 

**Average percent rural**: not done yet.

## Comparing of Suits Index across states 
We can compare the level of "regressivity" or "progressivity" (i.e., suits index) across states. For example, we could say Michigan is more progressive with its LWCF funds than Texas in regards to income. 

However, two states with different income distributions could have the same suits index. For example, Michigan and New Mexico may have different wealth distributions (ie Michigan is on average richer than New Mexico) but have the same suits index.  

## The sign of the suits index 
Suits indices are traditionally used to evaluate if a **tax** is progressive or regressive. A positive suits index is a progressive tax. The suits index is **typically** calculated as [(area under the neutral line) - (area under Lorenz curve)] / (area under the neutral line). 

The LWCF is a **subsidy** program. To keep signs consistent with "progressive" or "regressive" **I calculated the suits index as [(area under  Lorenz curve) - (area under the neutral line)] / (area under the neutral line)**.

**A positive suits index in our study indicates a progressive subsidy (least privileged get helped the most). A negative suits index indicates a regressive subsidy.**

myWorking_per_cap <- myWorking %>%

    mutate(quantity_per_cap = got_grant/ population) %>% #  quantity per capita each year
    group_by(fips) %>% # group by county
    mutate(amount_per_cap_cum = sum(amount_per_cap)) %>% # cumulative amount per cap
    mutate(quantity_per_cap_cum = sum(quantity_per_cap)) %>% # cumulative quantity per cap
    mutate(avg_med_income_house = mean(med_income_house, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% #average median income
    mutate(avg_poc_pct = mean(poc_pct, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    select(state_fips, fips, amount_per_cap_cum, quantity_per_cap_cum, avg_med_income_house, avg_poc_pct) %>% # set up reduce down to one entry per county
    distinct() # reduce

# Income 

## Nation Picture

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# results for nation 
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

myResult <- getSuits(myWorking_per_cap, x_axis = "Income")
printSuits(myResult, x_axis = "Income")
```

Interpretation note: makes sense that it's more progressive in quantity of grants administered than in amount of funds because of matching. We'd expect poorer counties to get smaller grants because they have less access to money for matching. 

I believe this.

# Conclusions 

* LWCF seems pretty progressive with regards to income 
* LWCF seems very regression when it comes to % POC. This matches up with what we say in the quartile study.

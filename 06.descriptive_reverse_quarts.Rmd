**Active years: 1975-2018 because the non-hispanic white characteristic is not available prior to 1980**


I get quartiles for the quantity of grants received after grouping by state and decade. I categorize a county with a "1" if the county receives the fewest number of grants. I categorize a county with a "4" if it receives the most amount of grants. Below, I look at the average percent of the population that is a certain demographic characteristic (ie white, people of color, below poverty line, etc) and see if there are trends in the percentage of certain demographic characteristics between the counties that get categorized with a 1 versus a 4. I do this averaging across all states and then do it again after dropping states whose counties' average population contains less than 10% POC (because they may be so homogeneous that they damped any true trends across quartiles that exist in more diverse states).


I repeat this process for the amount of funding received and the amount of funding received per capita.
